This tool allows to convert any DOC or DOCX file to several different 
formats such as plain text TXT (both DOS, Win, etc), or reach text RTF, or 
hyper-text HTML (default), MHT (web archive), XML, or PDF, or XPS. 

Using doc2fb.xsl file it is possible to convert to FictionBook format (FB2). 

There are options:

/H
    Outputs this help page.

/F:format
    Specifies output format as TXT, RTF, HTML, MHT, XML, PDF or XPS. 
    Additionally FB2 stands for transformations to FictionBook format.
